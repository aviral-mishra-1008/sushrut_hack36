Clinical Notes:
A complete blood count (CBC) is used to evaluate overall health and detect a wide range of disorders, including anemia,
infection, and leukemia. There have been some reports of WBC and platelet counts being lower in venous blood than in
capillary blood samples, although still within these reference ranges.
Possible causes of abnormal parameters:
High
Low
RBC, Hb, or HCT Dehydration, polycythemia, shock, chronic hypoxia Anemia, thalassemia, and other hemoglobinopathies
MCV
Macrocytic anemia, liver disease
Microcytic anemia
WBC
Platelets
